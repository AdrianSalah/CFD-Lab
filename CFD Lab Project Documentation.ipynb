    "Our code simulates chemical transport as well as catalytic chemical reactions of four chemical components \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\). We consider following reactions:\n",
    "\\\\[ A + B \\rightleftharpoons C  \\\\]\n",
    "i.e. the Haber process: \n",
    "\\\\[ N_{2} + 3H_{2} \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}  \\\\]\n",

    "Two additional scenarios \"**catalyst_reactor**\" and \"**catalyst_reactor2**\" where introduced to show the capability of the code. The parameterfile was extended with following parameters which can be set for each component individually\n",

    " In the subdirectory \"***geometry***\" the predefined pgm-files \"***catalyst_reactor.pgm***\" and \"***catalyst_reactor2.pgm***\" can be found. Both geometries contain an inflow boundary condition on the bottom, an outflow boundary condition on the top as well as adiabatic no-slip walls. An additional celltype was added to the PGM-file to model the catalyst. The first scenario contains vertical catalyst blocks inside the reactor with a coarser grid. The second one horizontal catalyst blocks attached to the walls reaching inside the catalyst reactor with a finer grid.\n",
